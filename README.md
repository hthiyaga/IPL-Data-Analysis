**Introduction**

The topic I chose for visualization is to show the overview of teams performance and the supporting factor in Indian Premier League(IPL) cricket. Cricket is like religion in India, by starting
IPL, cricket fever has reached the pinnacle because IPL has introduced style and entertainment at the grounds, fans hear loud music, see fireworks everytime batsman hits a boundary or when bowler takes a wicket.
Added to that, the name of every team is based on a state. This makes the citizen of that place to encourage and support them. Being an ardent of cricket, I wanted to find interesting
factors about the teams performance and how it supports in winning a match.
